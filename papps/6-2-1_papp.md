# 6-2-1 - Health tracking pApp
The single most important factor for a healthy and joyful Congress is the 6-2-1 rule:

```
- 6 hours of sleep
- 2 proper meals
- 1 shower

Repeat daily.
```

This pApp helps you to keep track. Fill out the ring segments throughout the day and try to close all rings. Can you achieve a 4 day streak?
