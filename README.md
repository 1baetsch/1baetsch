DIY congress badge creation

# Overview
We are excited to present you this years congress badge. One of the toughest problems when creating a badge is to keep it affordable. Previous badges like the rad1o or the r0ket included expensive parts like microcontrollers and LCDs, consume lots of nature destroying resources, and after the event - not being used anymore - disappear somewhere.
Luckily we have found a solution to make this years badge almost for free and use less resources.

Cheap badges are way more inclusive and ultimately allow more people to join in on the fun coming along with congress badges. The low costs allow you to create your own Version of 1bätsch completely on your own with a limited amount of tools and materials that you probably already own. But we'll also distribute a limited number of badges at congress.

Even more important than the badge itself are all the applications you create and run on it. We have devised a framework for those applications which we call PApps - short for paper apps. As with the badge templates we will provide some templates for PApps. But ultimately we encourage you to be creative, go wild and implement your own PApps.

1bätsch is fully customizable and way more than just a name tag. There is hardly anything you can't do with it. Take a look at the provided example PApps and you will see that there is a replacement for basically any app you have currently installed on e.g. your smartphone. But ultimately your creativity is the limit. So channel your inner kindergarten-self and get started.  


# Tools and Materials
Here is a list of tools and materials you'll likely use in creating your own 1bätsch and the PApps that go along with it:

 - Printer
 - Paper
 - Colored pencils
 - Scissor
 - Tape
 - Glue
 - Paper clips

# API (Analog Paper Interface)

Well, this API is based on cut'n'pasting a lot...

# PApps (Paper Apps)

PApps are the equivalent of Apps you all know, but in our new agile, analog App environment.
As we started to think of this new innovative, intuitive and usable badge, we already imagined some example PApps.
But we still need your help to develop and implement them.
## example PApps
* Schedule = Stundenplan zum selbst eintragen
* Messaging PApp = Fach mit vorgedruckten Briefen (nett designed) Rückseite mit Adressfeld / Zustellungsweg
* Forum PApp = Plakat zum Zettel aufkleben und so Nachrichtenstränge (Bulletin Board)
* Sudoku PApp = Normales Sudoku
* Park ticket PApp = Normaler Parkschein
* Pinder Dating App = Profile auf Papier schreiben
* Calendar App = Kalenderseiten für die vier Tage
* Maps = Floorplan zum Weg einzeichnen lassen
* Bookmark PApp = Lesezeichen oder schmale Post Its
* PInstagram = Polaroid camera
* Dropbox = Kiste zum Zettel rein tun
* Copy PApp = Papier zum durch schlagen
* Clock PApp = Sieben Segment Anzeige zum selber ausmalen
* Weather App = Zettel raus halten?
* Read only mode = Klarsichthülle
* Encryption PApp = Envelope for 1bätsch
* Error message/feedback = Zettel davor kleben
* Clipboard PApp = Tasche am badge dran

## Hardware addons
In addition to the brand new PApps listed above, we also came up with some hardware addons:

* Wearables = wrist band you can write on
    * Fitness PApp = Manual tally sheet of your steps

# Contributions
Contributions to this project are more than welcome. You could for example create a PR for this Repo. We are always looking for new and improved designs for 1bätsch or crazy PApp ideas. And we are sure that all you origami artists out there will come up with way better designs than we did. But even more awesome than digital contributions are real physical badges and PApps that you share with you fellow congress goers.
