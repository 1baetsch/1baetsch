DIY congress bätsch creation

# Overview
We are excited to present you this year's congress bätsch. One of the toughest problems when creating a bätsch is to keep it affordable. Previous bätschs like the rad1o or the r0ket included expensive parts like microcontrollers and LCDs, consume lots of nature destroying resources, and after the event - not being used anymore - disappear somewhere.
Luckily we have found a solution to make this year's bätsch almost for free and use less resources.

Affordable bätschs are way more inclusive and ultimately allow more people to join in on the fun coming along with congress bätschs. The low costs allow you to create your own version of 1bätsch completely on your own with a limited amount of tools and materials that you probably already own. But we'll also distribute a limited number of bätschs at congress.

Even more important than the bätsch itself are all the applications you create and run on it. We have devised a framework for those applications which we call pApps - short for paper apps. As with the bätsch templates we will provide some templates for pApps. But ultimately we encourage you to be creative, go wild and implement your own pApps.

1bätsch is fully customizable and way more than just a name tag. There is hardly anything you can't do with it. Take a look at the provided example pApps and you will see that there is a replacement for basically any app you have currently installed on e.g. your smartphone. But ultimately your creativity is the limit. So channel your inner kindergarten-self and get started.  


# Tools and Materials
Here is a list of tools and materials you'll likely use in creating your own 1bätsch and the pApps that go along with it:

 - Printer
 - Paper
 - Colored pencils
 - Scissor
 - Tape
 - Glue
 - Paper clips
 - Unicorn stickers

# API (Analog Paper Interface)

Well, this API is based on cut'n'paste technology...

# pApps (Paper Apps)

pApps are the equivalent of apps you all know, but in our new agile, analog app environment.
As we started to think of this new innovative, intuitive and usable bätsch, we already imagined some example pApps,
but we still need your help to develop and implement them.

## Example pApps

* Schedule = Timetable to enter your talks and assemblies
* Messaging pApp = Compartment with pretty (preprinted) letters / (your) address or a place to reach you on the back of each letter
* Sudoku pApp = Regular Sudoku
* Pinder Dating pApp = Write your profile on a piece of paper
* Calendar pApp = 4-page-calendar (one for each day of congress)
* Maps = Floorplan, where you or others can mark locations
* Bookmark pApp = Regular bookmarks or post its
* Pinstagram = Polaroid camera
* Copy pApp = Carbon paper
* Clock pApp = Seven segement display where you color in the segements youself
* Weather pApp = Stick a piece of paper out of the window
* Error message / feedback = Post it on top of something else
* Clipboard pApp = Pouch on your bätsch
* [Health tracking pApp](./papps/6-2-1_papp.md) = Health tracking based on the 6-2-1 rule

pApps requiring centralisation or addtional hardware:
* Dropbox = Just a box to place pieces of paper in
* Read only mode = Plastic sleeve around the bätsch
* [Encryption pApp](./papps/encryption_papp.md) = Envelope for 1bätsch / One Time Pads
* pitHUB pApp = Collaborate via a public tray for ideas written on paper
* Forum pApp = Bulletin board where you can pin messages (create threads by answering below anonther pinned message) 


## Hardware addons
In addition to the brand new pApps listed above, we also came up with some hardware addons:

* Wearables = wrist band you can write on
    * Fitness pApp = Manual tally sheet of your steps

# Contributions
Contributions to this project are more than welcome. You could for example create a PR for this repo. We are always looking for new and improved designs for 1bätsch or crazy pApp ideas. And we are sure that all you origami artists out there will come up with way better designs than we did. But even more awesome than digital contributions are real physical bätschs and pApps that you share with you fellow congress goers.
